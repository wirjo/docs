# How to Contribute a Vault Strategy

Yearn is only possible due to community contributions. [yVault](https://docs.yearn.finance/products/yvaults) strategy contributors are rewarded with a share of the fees generated by the vaults. 

## Strategy Rewards

Strategy contributors are rewarded with a percentage share of the fees generated by the vaults. Currently, this is allocated to be: 

* 10% for Strategy Contributor
* 90% for Governance

The reward is paid monthly in [yUSD](../yusd.md). 

As an example, in September 2020, community contributor [@orbxball](https://gov.yearn.finance/u/orbxball) developed the strategy for the yWETH vault. As such, the yWETH vault splits the 5% performance fee generated from the pool of assets between governance and strategist \([@orbxball](https://gov.yearn.finance/u/orbxball)\) in a 90/10 split.

## How to Contribute?

For inspiration, you can browse through the strategy proposals on the [Governance Forum](https://gov.yearn.finance/c/proposals/strategies/18). This can serve as examples to inspire your strategy proposals.  

When you are ready, you can create a yEarn Improvement Proposal \(YIP\) using the instructions and template provided on [How to Make a YIP](%20https://docs.yearn.finance/how-to-guides/how-to-make-a-yip). In your proposal, you may want to consider the following:

* Potential risks 
* Sustainability of the strategy 
* Alignment to the vision of yEarn
